# Salary Survey Project

## Description

This project goal is to create a comfortable template / skeleton for a quick salary survey analysis.
This code was used to analyze a salary survey among CS students at the Technion.  

You are more than welcome to use the code for your own survey analysis, or to contribute by opening new issues or submitting PR.
I will be happy to support you in the process and do my best to help with any challenges along the way. 

## Getting Started

### Using The Code For Your Survey

You will need a working python environment, with some basic libraries (e.g. pandas, matplotlib ..).

Change the file path to the path to your CSV (Which can easily be exported from google forms survey).


## Help

For any problem with the code, or problems you are facing during your survey analyzing, you are more than welcome to contact me in private, 
or open an issue.

## Contribute:

This is a great project to contribute to! mainly because it's fair and simple, and because I promise I would do my best to help you participant in it :)
You can find some issues I opened, a lot of them are marked as 'Good First Issue' and would be great for a student who wants to try and contribute for the first time
for an open-source project :)
Talk with me if you are having any trouble trying to contribute!
